# Website-Example
This project was completed as an assignment. We were to use XAMPP(for apache server), HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript to create a website and database
The project's primary focus is to show the creation and population of a database that can be accessed and traversed by authenticated users registered in the PHP 
system.
